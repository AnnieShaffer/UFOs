# UFO Analysis
## Overview
In this analysis, we assisted Dana with creating a webpage and table in which she can filter information regarding UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results
The webpage is incredibly easy to use and filter through.

1. Filters for date, city, state, country, and shape are located on the left side of the webpage with suggestions filled in to each box

2. Enter the desired date, city, state, country, or UFO shape in the search function
   - More than one field can be filled in at a time for this search

3. Once complete, the table will show the date, city, state, country, shape, the amount of time the sighting took place, and a decription of the sighting

## Summary
- One potential drawback of this design is that it does not give a range of the data for the user to know what to look through. This means that in order for the user to filter the data, they must have an idea of what all of the data looks like. This could be time consuming and take away the effciency of the filter function.

- Something that could be fixed in the future is that there could be table above showing some of the places or dates in which the sightings took place so that the user can have a guide for how to filter the table better.

- Additionally, there could also be a drop down used on the filter for the user to have the information instead of typing arbitrary dates or text into the search function.
